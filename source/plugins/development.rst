Why Plugins Matter in nxtbn
---------------------------

In nxtbn development, modifying core functionality directly is discouraged to maintain system integrity across updates. In certain situations, you may need to modify the core codebase, but plugins are generally the recommended approach. They allow you to extend nxtbn's capabilities seamlessly using Python. Whether your plugin is a simple script or a complex integration, leveraging the `meta_data` structure for plugin headers ensures clarity and compatibility. Plugins in nxtbn follow Pythonic and Django style conventions.

Before you dive deep into plugin development, make sure you have read the `plugin installation guide <installation.md>`_.

Harness the power of plugins to enhance nxtbn's functionality while adhering to best practices in Python and Django development.
